codename 0.2.0 (in development)
---------------------------------------------------------------------

- Remove "list" from `animals`. This was a function of copy-pasting a list I found somewhere, which itself was just copy-pasted or scraped without a lot of inspection to the output.
- Fix "chantio" to "chantico" in `gods`. My bad.
- Scrub documentation instances of "codename" to "code name." The former works well for the function and package name, but "code name" is proper English. I don't think anyone will notice or care.
- Force "any" options to be lowercase. Basically, the inclusion of the Wu-Tang names results in the mismatch. `{codename}` will permit title case only for the Wu-Tang name generator component of this package.
